  "about-description": "My name is Nhat Linh Nguyen, and I'm currently a student at EPITA, specializing in web development and applications. Passionate about full-stack development, I've already acquired solid professional experience through several work-study programs and internships. My expertise focuses on the maintenance, development of new features, and migration of web and mobile applications, notably with technologies such as ASP.NET, React Native, and Flutter. Curious and determined, I'm constantly looking for new challenges to broaden my skills. Versatile, I master a variety of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and C#, as well as frameworks like ReactJS and NextJS. Alongside my technical skills, I place great importance on team management and communication, both of which are essential to the successful completion of the projects I'm involved in. In addition to my IT skills, I'm trilingual, fluent in Vietnamese, French and English. I'm currently looking for a work-study position for the year 2024-2025 to continue developing my skills while actively contributing to innovative projects.",
